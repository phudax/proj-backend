# Toohak – Quiz Platform Backend

This repository contains the backend system for **Toohak**, an interactive quiz and game platform similar in concept to Kahoot. It provides a scalable REST API that supports user authentication, quiz creation, real-time sessions, scoring, and persistent data storage.

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **production-style backend** using modern JavaScript/TypeScript, RESTful APIs, and structured software engineering practices.

---

## What This Project Does

The backend supports:
- User registration and authentication
- Quiz creation and management
- Running live quiz sessions
- Player participation and scoring
- Secure session handling using tokens
- Persistent storage of users, quizzes, and game data
- Image uploads for quiz questions
- CSV export of results

The system was designed to support a real frontend application and to handle multiple concurrent users and sessions.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- REST APIs
- Jest (testing – removed from public repo)
- ESLint
- File-based persistence (JSON)
- Git & collaborative workflows

---

## Engineering Focus

This project was built using industry-style software engineering practices:
- Feature-based branching and merge requests
- Test-driven development
- CI-style linting and verification
- RESTful API design
- Secure authentication and session handling
- Incremental feature delivery
- Persistent state management

The backend is structured so that core business logic is separated from HTTP routing, making it easy to test, maintain, and extend.

## Portfolio Notice

This repository is a **portfolio-safe adaptation** of a university group project.

All of the following have been **removed**:
- Assignment specifications
- Marking rubrics
- Test suites
- Auto-grading scripts
- Provided scaffolding
- Course documentation
- API specs

Only my **own implementation, architecture, and engineering work** remains in this public version.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase:
- Backend system design
- API engineering
- Data modelling
- Version control practices
- Real-world software development skills

---

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build scalable backend systems
- Work with real application state and users
- Design RESTful APIs
- Manage complexity across multiple features
- Collaborate in a team using professional Git workflows
- Write maintainable, production-ready code
